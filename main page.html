    An operating system (OS) is the program that, after being initially loaded into the computer by a boot program,
    manages all of the other application programs in a computer.
    The application programs make use of the operating system by making requests for services through a defined application program
    interface (API). In addition, users can interact directly with the operating system through a user interface, such as
    a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical UI (GUI).
